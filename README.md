## Background
- I created as pre-course work prior to entering the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp
- much of my working knowledge of code to this point came from a web development Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp

## Take Aways
- This project boosted my self-confidence to create not just a minimal game, but to add more features such as game achievements and collaspable cards.

## Technologies

- CSS
- JavaScript
